# ElysiumSuites

Phase 1 Project: Elysium Suites

Nicole Casteel & Hannah Schwaeble

Using a JSON database formulated by us, we have created a one page site for the hotel, Elysium Suites. The site is chalked full of information for potential hotel guests, and even includes an area for feedback from those who have stayed in one of Elysium Suites' seven gorgeous rooms and a like button for users to show their favor to a particular room.

Functionality:
A site guest is able to select a room from the rooms menu at the top of the page. The selected room will then be displayed in the middle of the page. Below the selected room, the reviews for this room will populate and the guest will be able to add a review of their own. If a site guest is a fan of a certain room they can add a like to the room with the like button located below the room description.
